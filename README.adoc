_Made in collaboration with https://twitter.com/DZnnah[DZnnah]_

This repo contains the Unreal-Engine (5.3) port of the https://github.com/grrimgrriefer/TalkToMeCPP[TalkToMeCPP (Windows c++)] +
*Note:* Uses third-party SignalR client: link:Source/SignalR/License.txt[LICENSE]

== Structure

.The code is separated in 4 modules
* SignalR: Contains the Unreal port of the SignalR c++ client.
* TalkToMeCppUE: Contains demo-project related files.
* Voxta: A stateful client for the encapsulation of the Voxta server API.
* VoxtaData: The models which encapsulate the Voxta data in easy-to-use data objects. (i.e. data structs)

== Dev Progress

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Project set-up (SignalR, Logging, C++ module separation, etc)

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Port text-chat code from TalkToMeCPP to Unreal

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Add temporary UI for debugging

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Code cleanup & refactoring

[ :fire: ]   Swap windows audio API for UE to ensure cross-platform compatibility

[ :black_square_button: ]   Expose main functionality to blueprints & swap UI c++ code with exclusive blueprint

[ :black_square_button: ]   Create a demo by hooking up playback to MetaHuman

[ :black_square_button: ]   Wrap modules into a plugin

[ :black_square_button: ]   Unit testing? (not sure if applicable for UE)

== Running the project

.Steps to get this up and running
. Clone the repository.
. Right-click on the .UProject and select the option to Generate VS files.
. Configure the startup project to be TalkToMeCPPUE
. Select DevelopmentEditor with Win64 and run the debugger.
. Ensure you have your Voxta Server running and press play in the editor once it's started up.

Blueprint is not yet supported, will be soonish though.
