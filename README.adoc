= TalkToMeCPPUE - An Unreal Engine C++ client implementation for Voxta

_Made in collaboration with https://twitter.com/DZnnah[DZnnah]_

This repo contains the Unreal-Engine (5.3) port of the https://github.com/grrimgrriefer/TalkToMeCPP[TalkToMeCPP (Windows c++)] +
*Note:* Uses MIT licensed SignalR client: link:Source/SignalR/License.txt[LICENSE] +
*Note:* Uses MIT licensed wav-decoding from the RuntimeAudioImporter: link:Source/AudioUtility/Public/RuntimeAudioImporter/LICENSE.txt[LICENSE]

== Structure

.The code is separated in 5 modules
* AudioUtility: Contains all the logic in regards to audioplayback and audio input
* SignalR: Contains the Unreal port of the SignalR c++ client.
* TalkToMeCppUE: Contains demo-project related files.
* Voxta: A stateful client for the encapsulation of the Voxta server API.
* VoxtaData: The models which encapsulate the Voxta data in easy-to-use data objects. (i.e. data structs)

== Dev Progress

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Project set-up (SignalR, Logging, C++ module separation, etc)

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Port text-chat code from TalkToMeCPP to Unreal

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Add temporary UI for debugging

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Code cleanup & refactoring

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Swap windows audio API for UE to ensure cross-platform compatibility

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Code cleanup & refactoring 2: the quest for better code

[ :fire: ]   Wrap modules into a plugin

[ :black_square_button: ]   Hook up OVR lipsync to the audioplayback.

[ :black_square_button: ]   Make a proof-of-concept demo using a default Metahuman (integrate it with OVR lipsync)

[ :black_square_button: ]   Expose main functionality to blueprints & use them to replace the C++ bindings atm

[ :black_square_button: ]   Unit testing? (not sure if applicable for UE)

== Example implementation project

.Available here: https://dev.azure.com/grrimgrriefer/_git/UnrealVoxtaTestProject 
. Clone the repository. *(Note: this repo uses Git LFS)*
. Open the VoxtaTestProject.uproject
. Press play

.Debugging:
. Right-click on the .uproject and select the option to Generate VS files.
. Configure the startup project to be VoxtaTestProject
. Select DevelopmentEditor with Win64 and run the debugger.
. Ensure you have your Voxta Server running and press play in the editor once it's started up.
. In the VoxtaClient.cpp, make sure you swap the IP address of the server to the one you use.

Blueprint is not yet supported, will be soonish though.
