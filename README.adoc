This repo contains the Unreal-Engine (5.3) port of the https://github.com/grrimgrriefer/TalkToMeCPP[TalkToMeCPP (Windows c++)] +
*Note:* Uses third-party SignalR client: link:Source/SignalR/License.txt[LICENSE]

== Structure

.The code is separated in 4 modules
* SignalR: Contains the Unreal port of the SignalR c++ client.
* TalkToMeCppUE: Contains demo-project related files.
* Voxta: A stateful client for the encapsulation of the Voxta server API.
* VoxtaData: The models which encapsulate the Voxta data in easy-to-use data objects. (i.e. data structs)
