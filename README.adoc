= UnrealVoxta - An Unreal Engine client implementation for Voxta

_Made in collaboration with https://twitter.com/DZnnah[DZnnah]_ +

This repo contains the Unreal-Engine (5.3) port of the https://github.com/grrimgrriefer/TalkToMeCPP[TalkToMeCPP (Windows c++)] +
*Note:* Uses MIT licensed SignalR client: link:Source/SignalR/License.txt[LICENSE] +
*Note:* Uses MIT licensed wav-decoding from the RuntimeAudioImporter: link:Source/AudioUtility/Public/RuntimeAudioImporter/LICENSE.txt[LICENSE] +

If you like C++ you can already use this, for blueprint API: please come back in late September. 

== Example implementation project

.Available here: https://dev.azure.com/grrimgrriefer/_git/UnrealVoxtaTestProject 
. Clone the repository. *(Note: both this and the project repo use Git LFS)*
. In the VoxtaClient.cpp, make sure you swap the IP address to the address that you use to host VoxtaServer.
. Recompile the project (or use livecoding in-engine)
. Open the VoxtaTestProject.uproject
. Ensure you have Voxta open & properly configured.
. Press play

== Structure

.The code is separated in 5 modules
* AudioUtility: Contains all the logic in regards to audioplayback and audio input
* SignalR: Contains the Unreal port of the SignalR c++ client.
* UnrealVoxta: A stateful client for the encapsulation of the Voxta server API.
* VoxtaData: The models which encapsulate the Voxta data in easy-to-use data objects. (i.e. data structs)
* VoxtaUtility: Wrappers for communicating with the Voxta Server API, also includes Logging and utility-specific defines.

*Note:* There is currently a hard requirement for the OVRLipSync, this will be converted into an optional dependency later on. 
(OVRLipSync is not compatible with UE 5.3 out of the box, just use the fixed one from the Example implementation project linked above.)

== Dev Progress

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Project set-up (SignalR, Logging, C++ module separation, etc)

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Port text-chat code from TalkToMeCPP to Unreal

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Add temporary UI for debugging

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Code cleanup & refactoring

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Swap windows audio API for UE to ensure cross-platform compatibility

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Code cleanup & refactoring 2: the quest for better code

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Wrap modules into a plugin

[ :heavy_check_mark: ]   Hook up OVR lipsync to the audioplayback & to a default MetaHuman.

[ :fire: ]   Code cleanup & refactoring 3: Revenge of the syntax

[ :black_square_button: ]   Expose main functionality to blueprints & use them to replace the C++ bindings atm

[ :black_square_button: ]   Make a full demo application to show the capabilities of the plugin
